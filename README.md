# pandas-challenge

This code merges and analyzes two datasets, one about students and the other about the schools they attend. It looks at student performance on a reading and math assessment at a district and school level and segments these data by various characteristics of the school such as budget per student and school size. 

The code used in this challenge was developed by myself and the resources provided by the UMN Data Analytics bootcamp.
