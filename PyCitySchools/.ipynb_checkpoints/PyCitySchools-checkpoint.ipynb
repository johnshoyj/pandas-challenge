    "This analysis provides a district overall summary of the number of students assessed, the district budget, the most recent reading and math average score, passing rates, and combined passing rate (reading and math). The report goes on to summarize these data by school as well as provide a per student budget within each school. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the school level summary it was possible to analyze which schools were top performing and which were the lowest performing. The results of these analyses are shown in the tables labeled \"Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\" and \"Bottom Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional summary tables show math and reading scores by grade, school spending, school size, and school type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two key findings resulting from this analysis are as follows: \n",
    "- A higher per student budget did not equate to better test results for students. Each of the top performing schools, with the exception of Thomas High School, had lower per student budgets than each of the bottom perfoming schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What does seem to have an impact on student outcomes is school size. Students who attend small (<1000) and medium (1000-2000) sized schools had higher average scores and passing rates that students who attended large schools, defined as having 2000-5000 students enrolled.\n",
